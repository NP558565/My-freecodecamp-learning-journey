## 1. Say Hello to HTML Elements

The code in your code editor that says `<h1>Hello</h1>`? That's an HTML element.
Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.

Opening tags look like this: `<h1>`

Closing tags look like this: `</h1>`

The only difference between opening and closing tags is the forward slash after the opening bracket of a closing tag.

**Test** : To pass the test on this challenge, change your `h1` element's text to say "Hello World".


```html
<!-- GIVEN -->
<h1>Hello</h1>

<!-- SOLUTION -->
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```
