## 7. Delete HTML Elements
Our phone doesn't have much vertical space.

Let's remove the unnecessary elements so we can start building our CatPhotoApp.

**Test** : Delete your `h1` element so we can simplify our view.

```html
<!-- GIVEN -->
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

<!-- SOLUTION -->
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```
