/*You can start by working through their self-paced, browser-based full stack JavaScript curriculum.*/

By working through their curriculum, one we can earn four certifications:
#1. Front End Certification
The first section will teach you the basics of how webpages work and also introduce you to JavaScript programming.

Skills you'll practice include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap.

To earn this certification, you'll build 10 front-end projects and implement many JavaScript algorithms.

#2. Data Visualization Certification
The second section builds upon the first and introduces you to more advanced topics such as Sass, React and D3.

To earn this certification, you'll build 5 React-apps and 5 Data visualization apps using D3.js.

#3. Back End Certification
The third section introduces you to back end development using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It also teaches you about the important concept of source control using Git.

To earn this certification, you'll build 5 APIs and 5 full stack apps.

#4. Full Stack Certification
The fourth section is where you'll get real-world experience by working on projects for nonprofits. We'll pair you with another camper, an agile project manager, and a stakeholder from a nonprofit organization. Together, you'll plan, build and maintain apps that help that nonprofit carry out its mission more effectively.

For this certification, you'll work on two projects from scratch and then maintain/upgrade two existing projects.
