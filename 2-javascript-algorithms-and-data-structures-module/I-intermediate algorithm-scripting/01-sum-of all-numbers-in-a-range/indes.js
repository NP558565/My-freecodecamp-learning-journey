/*Sum All Numbers in a Range
We'll pass you an array of two numbers. Return the sum of those two numbers plus the 
sum of all the numbers between them. The lowest number will not always come first.

For example, sumAll([4,1]) should return 10 because sum of all the numbers between 1 
and 4 (both inclusive) is 10.*/

function sumAll(arr) {
  let sumBetween = 0;
  for (let i = Math.min(...arr); i <= Math.max(...arr); i++) {
    sumBetween += i;
  }
  return sumBetween;
}

sumAll([1, 4]);

/*Code Explanation
Creating a variable sum to store the sum of the elements.
Starting iteration of the loop from min element of given array and stopping when it reaches the max element.
Using a spread operator (â€¦arr) allows passing the actual array to the function instead of one-by-one elements.*/
