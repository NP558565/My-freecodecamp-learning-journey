/*You can also use _bracket notation_ to get the character at other positions within 
a string.
Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the 
zeroth character.

Let's try to set _thirdLetterOfLastName_ to equal the third letter of 
the _lastName_ variable using bracket notation.
Hint
Try looking at the _secondLetterOfFirstName_ variable declaration if you get stuck.*/


// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
