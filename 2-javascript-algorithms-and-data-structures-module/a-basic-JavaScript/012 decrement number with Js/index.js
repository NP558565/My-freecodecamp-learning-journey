/*You can easily _decrement_ or decrease a variable by one with the `--` operator.
```javascript
i--;
```
is the equivalent of
```javascript
i = i - 1;
```
**Note**
The entire line becomes `i--;,` eliminating the need for the equal sign.
Change the code to use the `--` operator on myVar.*/

var myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar--;
