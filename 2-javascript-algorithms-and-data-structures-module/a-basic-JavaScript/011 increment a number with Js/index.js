/*You can easily _increment_ or add one to a variable with the `++` operator.

```javascript
i++;
```
is the equivalent of

```javascript
i = i + 1;
```
**note**
The entire line becomes `i++;,` eliminating the need for the equal sign.
Change the code to use the `++` operator on `myVar`.*/

// Only change code below this line
