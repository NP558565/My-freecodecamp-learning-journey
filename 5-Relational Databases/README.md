# Relational Databases Curriculum

📚 A Journey through Database Technologies

This documents my experience with the Relational Databases curriculum on freeCodeCamp. I'd like to share how this topic challenged me and what I've learned along the way.

## Introduction

The Relational Databases curriculum was a significant learning experience for me. It wasn't the complexity that posed a challenge, but rather the dedication and long hours of work that were required to truly grasp the concepts.

## Technologies Explored

During this curriculum, I explored the following programming technologies:

- **Bash Terminal:** I learned the basics of command-line interaction, which proved to be essential for managing databases.
- **PostgreSQL:** I delved into the world of relational databases, understanding how data is organized and queried efficiently.
- **Git:** Version control using Git became second nature, enabling collaborative coding and tracking changes effectively.
